## First Status Update (July 14, 2021):
After starting with the software development plan I noticed that my original plan, which I shared with my instructor as the application pitch, was missing a few things. For example, I have added a feature to allow users to flag/unflag cells. 
I also  changed the plan for how the user will choose the game difficulty and board size. Instead of taking these as arguments from the bash script and passing them to the Python application, I decided that it would be better and cleaner to let the Python application interact with the users and get their choice.
As for the actual implementation, everything is going very smoothly. I have finished the hardest part of the application before the suggested deadline and the path forward is very clear.

## Second Status Update (July 16, 2021):
I have finished working on all the features and the Python application is finalized and is working perfectly as planned. 
I have tested all the features with different scenarios and faced no issues at all. I beleive the final testing was highly successful mostly because of 2 things:
- I wrote all the functions in a modular and standalone way where each function was not aware how and where it was being called, and therefore assuming that the parameter(s) passed to it might be wrong and that it should validate the parameter(s).
- I was thoroughly testing every small part I was adding to the code. 
By the end of the day I should be done with writing the bash scripts that will wrap the application and tomorrow will be dedicated to finalizing the documentations. All is going perfectly as scheduled.
