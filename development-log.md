## First Status Update:
After starting with the software development plan I noticed that my original plan, which I shared with my instructor as the application pitch, was missing a few things. For example, I have added a feature to allow users to flag/unflag cells. 
I also  changed the plan for how the user will choose the game difficulty and board size. Instead of taking these as arguments from the bash script and passing them to the Python application, I decided that it would be better and cleaner to let the Python application interact with the users and get their choice.
As for the actual implementation, everything is going very smoothly. I have finished the hardest part of the application before the suggested deadline and the path forward is very clear.
